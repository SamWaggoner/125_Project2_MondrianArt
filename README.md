# 125_Project2_MondrianArt
My second project from Fall 2020, COS 125 with Penny Rheingans.
This program creates an HTML page that imitates the art of Mondrian.
The program that satisfies the assignment is called Waggoner_P2.py and the extra credit version called Waggoner_P2_Varied is the more exciting version, where colors are modified to make a more satisfying visual.
